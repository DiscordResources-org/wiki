### Dragory's ModMail (self-host)

> **Description:** Modmail Bot is a bot for Discord that allows users to DM the bot to contact the server's
> moderators/staff without messaging them individually or pinging them publicly on the server. These DMs get relayed to
> ModMail threads, channels where staff members can reply to and talk with the user. To the user, the entire process
> happens in DMs with the bot.   <br/>
